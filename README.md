# Stegio 

This project implements an image steganography tool that allows users to hide secret messages within images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method. The tool consists of functionalities for encoding a message into an image and decoding a hidden message from an image.





## Algorithm Used: Least Significant Bit (LSB) Method

The LSB method is a common technique used in steganography to embed information into an image. It works by altering the least significant bits of the image pixel values to encode the secret message.
